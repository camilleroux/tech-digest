A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) skill that aggregates top developer RSS feeds and produces a clean daily digest — sorted by day, deduplicated, filtered by vote count.

![Demo of /digest](demo.gif)

## What it does

Type `/digest` in Claude Code and get a structured recap of the best tech articles from the last 7 days — sourced from Hacker News (100+ points), Lobste.rs, The Changelog, and more.

```
# Tech Digest -- April 7 to April 13, 2026
> 12 articles from 3 sources over the last 7 days

## Sunday, April 13, 2026

- **The peril of laziness lost** -- `engineering` -- *Lobste.rs*
  On the hidden costs of over-engineering and how simplicity compounds...

## Saturday, April 12, 2026
- ...
```

## Features

- Aggregates **RSS 2.0 and Atom** feeds from top developer sources
- **Filters by vote count** — only the best articles per source, not just the most recent
- Recap grouped by **day**, with automatic deduplication
- Ultra-fast: **~1 second** (pure Python stdlib, zero external dependencies)
- **Parallel feed fetching** (multi-thread)
- Fully configurable sources via a simple YAML file
- Works on **macOS and Linux**

## Installation

## Sources included

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) | Top tech stories with 100+ points (via hnrss.org) |
| [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) | Curated tech links voted on by the developer community |
| [The Changelog](https://changelog.com) | News and podcasts for developers |

## Add a source

Edit `~/.claude/skills/digest/sources.yml` and add a block:

```yaml
  - name: My Source
    url: https://example.com/feed.rss
    site: https://example.com
    description: Short description of the source
    limit: 3  # optional: keep top N articles by score per day
```

Any valid RSS 2.0 or Atom feed is supported. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to propose a default source.

## Architecture

```
tech-digest/
├── skills/digest/
│   ├── SKILL.md           # Skill definition (instructions for Claude)
│   ├── sources.yml        # Configurable list of RSS feeds
│   └── fetch_feeds.py     # Python script (parallel fetch + XML parse + score filter)
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/ci.yml   # Python syntax validation + feed test

├── CONTRIBUTING.md        # Contribution guide
└── README.md
```

**How it works:** when you type `/digest`, Claude Code reads `SKILL.md` which tells it to run `fetch_feeds.py`. The Python script fetches RSS feeds in parallel, parses XML, filters by date, ranks by score (vote count), deduplicates by URL, and returns articles as TSV. Claude then formats the result as markdown.

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/digest
```

Or via script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CamilleRoux/tech-digest/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```
